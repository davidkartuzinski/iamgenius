The world's greatest geniuses have all had 24 personality characteristics in common — and you can develop the same traits in yourself, says an expert.

"But if you look at the lives of the world's greatest geniuses -- like Edison, Socrates, DaVinci, Shakespeare, Einstein -- you discover they all had 24 personality characteristics in common."
