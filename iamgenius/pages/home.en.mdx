## 24 Qualities That Geniuses Have in Common

The world's greatest geniuses have all had 24 personality characteristics in common — and you can develop the same traits in yourself, says an expert.

"Most people have the mistaken idea that geniuses are born, not made," declared clinical psychologist Dr. Alfred Barrios, founder and directory of the Self-Programmed Control Center of Los Angeles and author of the book, "Towards Greater Freedom and Happiness."

"But if you look at the lives of the world's greatest geniuses -- like Edison, Socrates, DaVinci, Shakespeare, Einstein -- you discover they all had 24 personality characteristics in common."

"These are traits that anyone can develop. It makes no difference how old you are, how much education you have, or what you have accomplished to date. Adopting these personality characteristics enables you to operate on a genius level."

Here are the 24 characteristics Dr. Barrios lists which enable geniuses to come up with and develop new and fruitful ideas:
